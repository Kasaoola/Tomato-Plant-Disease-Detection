Tomato Plant Disease Detection using CNN
This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify tomato plant diseases from leaf images. The backend is built with FastAPI, while the frontend offers a user-friendly interface for image uploads and result visualization. The full-stack application is containerized with Docker and was deployed on Microsoft Azure.

üìñ Overview
The goal of this project is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals by providing an automated system to detect common tomato plant diseases through image analysis. By utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, the system can identify and classify diseases, enabling timely interventions and reducing crop losses.

‚ú® Features
Automated Disease Detection: Identifies and classifies tomato plant diseases from leaf images.

Web Interface: User-friendly frontend for uploading images and viewing results.

FastAPI: Backend built with FastAPI to handle requests and model inference.

Containerization: Dockerized application for easy deployment.

Cloud Deployment: Previously deployed on Microsoft Azure using a free $200 credit.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Machine Learning: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Containerization: Docker

Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure

üß† Model Details
Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Dataset: Data are taken from PlantVIllage Dataset. The data has different types of diseases for tomato leaves. The dataset can be viewed in the folder: tomato-disease --> training --> PlantVillage
Here are the list:

Tomato_mosaic_virus
Target_Spot
Bacterial_spot
Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus
Late_blight
Leaf_Mold
Early_blight
Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite
Tomato___healthy
Septoria_leaf_spot

Training: Different models have been trained using different optimizers like Adam, SGD, RMSprop and Adagrad. Also dropoyt layers have been added to analyze the difference in the model along with changes in parameters like batch size, image size and number of layers. The models can be seen in the folder: tomato-disease --> training

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Challenges
Deployment: The application was deployed using a free Azure credit, which has since expired.

Data Quality: The accuracy of disease detection is contingent on the quality and clarity of the input images.

Model Generalization: The model's performance on images from different sources or environments may vary.
